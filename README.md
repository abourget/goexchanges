Bitcoin Exchanges APIs in Go
============================

Supports:

* cavirtex (partially) http://godoc.org/github.com/abourget/goexchanges/cavirtex
* quadrigacx (partially)

This repo is quite new, and there's no interface to unite the
different exchanges APIs right now.  Hopefully we get there some time.
